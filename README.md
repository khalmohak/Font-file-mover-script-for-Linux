# Font-file-mover-script-for-Linux
This is script is written in Python.

Downloading and installing fonts in Linux system is a tedious task, to make it easy I've written this Python script.


It will automaticaly take the file from Downloads folder, if it is a zip file then automaticaly unzip it and move it to the fonts folder.
and even run a special command so that the system knows new fonts have been installed

to run this 
just type sudo python script.py in your terminal
